# Hugo Action

Easy to use action to build your Hugo homepage using the [klakegg/hugo Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/klakegg/hugo) made available.


## Getting started

Your workflow is written in e.g. `.github/workflows/hugo.yml`.

Simple workflow example using the latest and lightest image:

```yaml
name: Hugo

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0

    - name: hugo
      uses: klakegg/actions-hugo@1.0.0
```

More advanced workflow example using matrix with multiple versions and image types:

```yaml
name: Hugo

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        version: [0.56.3, 0.57.2]
        image: [busybox, alpine]

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 0

    - name: hugo
      uses: klakegg/actions-hugo@1.0.0
      with:
        version: ${{ matrix.version }}
        image: ${{ matrix.image }}
```
